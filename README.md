## Installing

Install this extension using the install link: https://owl-trackers.onrender.com/manifest.json

The extension can be installed from the [store page](https://extensions.owlbear.rodeo/owl-trackers) or the extensions menu in your Owlbear Rodeo room.

## How it Works

This extension allows you to track up to twelve stats on your tokens for any gaming system you use.

### The Basics

**Right click** on a token to access the **context menu embed** and edit a token's stats.

**Inline math** lets you do addition or subtraction inside a tracker's text field.

There are three different inline math commands, using 7 as an example number:

- "-7" subtract 7 from the current tracker value
- "+7" add 7 to the current tracker value
- "=-7" set the trackers value to -7

The **three dots icon** in the context embed opens the **editor** which gives you more in depth control over a token's trackers.

In the editor you can give a tracker a name, a colour, toggle whether or not it is displayed on the map, toggle whether or not inline math is enabled, and rearrange the trackers. You may want to disable inline math if you want to store negative numbers in the tracker.

### Scene Defaults

You can set default trackers for the scene in the **action popover** by clicking the three dots icon next to the "Set scene default trackers" label.

This will open the **scene defaults editor**, which is very similar to the editor but for the scene instead of a specific token. Say, for example, that you play D&D. You might want every creature to have Hit Points, Temporary Hit Points and Armor Class.

Once you've set the defaults for the scene you can add them to any token with a single click.

### Uninstalling

Refresh your page after uninstalling the extension to clear trackers from the map. Token data will **not** be deleted by uninstalling.
